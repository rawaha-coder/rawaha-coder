## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Zakariae El kadiri
### DevOps engineer / Software developer

Motivated junior DevOps engineer and software developer with hands-on experience in automating processes, managing cloud infrastructure, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. I have a solid grasp of DevOps principles, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform, and containerization with Docker.

Skilled in a variety of programming languages, including Java, Kotlin, C#, and Go, I bring versatility to both development and operations tasks. My experience spans Linux environments, Git for version control, and scripting with Python and Bash to streamline workflows and improve system reliability.

Currently focused on deepening my expertise in cloud platforms, Kubernetes orchestration, and modern DevOps practices, while continuously improving my coding skills in multiple languages.
